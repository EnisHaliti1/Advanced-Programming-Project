# Clinic Booking Microservices (Spring Boot)

This project is a cloud-ready microservices backend for a small clinic. It manages patients, doctors & time slots, and appointments across three Spring Boot services:
- **patient-service**
- **doctor-service**
- **appointment-service**

All traffic flows through a Spring Cloud Gateway, with Google OAuth2 (JWT) securing sensitive endpoints. The project ships with CI/CD via GitHub Actions (builds & pushes Docker images) and Docker Compose for local deployment.
Ready to explore how itâ€™s structured and how to run it? Letâ€™s dive in together.

## Architecture

- API Gateway (8085)
  Single entry point. Routes to the three services and enforces security:
    - Public: GET /doctors/**
    - Protected: everything else (/patients, /appointments, etc.)
    - Uses Google OAuth2.
- patient-service (8080, MongoDB)
  Stores patient records. Exposes CRUD-style endpoints (create, list, get by nationalId, update, delete).
- doctor-service (8083, MySQL)
  Stores doctors and their time slots. Exposes endpoints to fetch a doctor, list a doctorâ€™s time slots, and reserve a time slot.
- appointment-service (8084, MySQL)
  Orchestrates bookings. Uses WebClient to:
    1. Fetch patient data from patient-service.
    2. Reserve a time slot in doctor-service.
    3. Persist the appointment locally if both steps succeed.
- Persistence
    - patient-service â†’ MongoDB (mongo-patient)
    - doctor-service â†’ MySQL (mysql-doctor)
    - appointment-service â†’ MySQL (mysql-appointment)
- Configuration & Deployment
    - All services are containerized with Docker and wired together via docker-compose.
    - Cross-service base URLs and DB hosts/ports are injected through environment variables.
    - GitHub Actions builds and pushes images for each service on every push.
- Ports (host â†’ container)
    - Gateway 8085 â†’ 8085
    - patient-service 8080 â†’ 8080 (Mongo 27017 â†’ 27017)
    - doctor-service 8083 â†’ 8083 (MySQL 3309 â†’ 3306)
    - appointment-service 8084 â†’ 8084 (MySQL 3310 â†’ 3306)

### Tech Stack:
  - Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Spring WebFlux (WebClient)
  - Spring Cloud Gateway, OAuth2 Resource Server (Google JWT)
  - MongoDB, MySQL
  - Maven, JUnit 5, Mockito
  - Docker, Docker Compose
  - GitHub Actions (CI/CD for building & pushing images)

**Figure:** Deployment diagram illustrating the request flow through the **API Gateway** to the three microservices and their databases.  
Key points:
- All clients (Postman / browser) call the **Gateway (8085)**.
- **Public routes**: `GET /doctors/**`. **Protected routes** (JWT via Google OAuth2): `/patients/**`, `/appointments/**`, etc.
- **patient-service** (8080) persists to **MongoDB**.
- **doctor-service** (8083) persists to **MySQL** and exposes **time slot reservation**.
- **appointment-service** (8084) orchestrates bookings using **WebClient** to call patient- and doctor-service, then stores the appointment in MySQL.
- Services are containerized and wired with **Docker Compose**; base URLs & DB settings are provided via environment variables.

## Services and Endpoints

### **All Endpoints**

#### Patient Service (protected)
- **POST** `/patients` -> Create patient
- **GET** `/patients?nationalId=BEL123` -> Get patient by nationalId
- **GET** `/patients/all` -> List all patients
- **PUT** `/patients/{nationalId}` -> Update patient
- **DELETE** `/patients/{nationalId}` -> Delete patient

#### Doctor Service
- **GET** `/doctors/{id}` -> Get doctor (ðŸ’¡ Public)
- **GET** `/doctors/{id}/timeslots` -> List time slots (ðŸ’¡ Public )
- **POST** `/timeslots/reserve` -> Reserve a time slot (Protected)

#### Appointment Service (protected)
- **POST** `/appointments` -> Book appointment
- **GET** `/appointments` -> List all appointments

**Services**
- mongo-patient (MongoDB) â€” persistent volume mongodb_patient_data, exposed on 27017.
- mysql-doctor (MySQL) â€” root pwd abc123, volume mysql_doctor_data, host port 3309 â†’ 3306.
- mysql-appointment (MySQL) â€” root pwd abc123, volume mysql_appointment_data, host port 3310 â†’ 3306.
- patient-service â€” uses MONGO_DB_HOST=mongo-patient, MONGO_DB_PORT=27017, exposed 8080.
- doctor-service â€” uses MYSQL_DB_HOST=mysql-doctor, MYSQL_DB_PORT=3306, exposed 8083.
- appointment-service â€” uses MYSQL_DB_HOST=mysql-appointment, plus PATIENT_SERVICE_BASEURL=patient-service:8080, DOCTOR_SERVICE_BASEURL=doctor-service:8083, exposed 8084.
- api-gateway â€” routes everything on 8085, with base URLs set to the internal service names
  
**Data persistence**
- Named volumes: mongodb_patient_data, mysql_doctor_data, mysql_appointment_data.

## Quick Start (Run Locally)

**Prerequisites**
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Postman or curl for testing
  
1. **Clone & start**
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EnisHaliti1/Advanced-Programming-Project.git
  cd Advanced-Programming-Project
  docker compose up -d
```
Check containers: docker compose ps

You should see: mongo-patient, mysql-doctor, mysql-appointment, patient-service, doctor-service, appointment-service, api-gateway

2. Ports overview
```bash
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8085
- patient-service: 8080 (behind gateway)
- doctor-service: 8083 (behind gateway)
- appointment-service: 8084 (behind gateway)
- MongoDB: 27017, MySQL: 3309 (doctor), 3310 (appointment)
```

3. Smoke test (public routes)
<img width="927" height="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fcd3fe9-269b-4284-a69f-b02e1b4d5bc1" />

4. Protected routes (JWT required)
   
Most /patients/** and /appointments/** endpoints require a Google ID token:

**Postman**

  - Authorization â†’ Type: OAuth 2.0 â†’ Get New Access Token
    <img width="1243" height="406" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e17be37-e7b3-4a9a-8c65-acec1df213de" />

    - Callback URL: https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
    - Auth URL: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
    - Access Token URL: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
    - Scope: openid profile email
    - Use the ID token as Bearer <id_token> (Authorization tab).
